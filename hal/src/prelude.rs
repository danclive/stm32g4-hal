//! Convenience re-export of multiple traits.
//!
//! This allows a HAL user to conveniently import this module and have all the
//! helper traits already imported.
//! Otherwise the use of peripherals would require the import of the
//! corresponding module and the import of the trait, which connects this HAL
//! to the autogenerated svd2rust API in [crate::pac].
