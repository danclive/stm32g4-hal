            description: HSI48 oscillator smooth trimming These bits provide a user-programmable trimming value to the HSI48 oscillator. They can be programmed to adjust to variations in voltage and temperature that influence the frequency of the HSI48. The default value is 32, which corresponds to the middle of the trimming interval. The trimming step is around 67 kHz between two consecutive TRIM steps. A higher TRIM value corresponds to a higher output frequency. When the AUTOTRIMEN bit is set, this field is controlled by hardware and is read-only.

To guarantee the required clock precision after waking up from Sleep mode, the LSE or reference clock on the GPIOs should be used as SYNC signal.'

            name: SYNCOKF
            description: SYNC event OK flag This flag is set by hardware when the measured frequency error is smaller than FELIM * 3. This means that either no adjustment of the TRIM value is needed or that an adjustment by one trimming step is enough to compensate the frequency error. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCOKIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCOKC bit in the CRS_ICR register.

            description: SYNC warning flag This flag is set by hardware when the measured frequency error is greater than or equal to FELIM * 3, but smaller than FELIM * 128. This means that to compensate the frequency error, the TRIM value must be adjusted by two steps or more. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCWARNIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCWARNC bit in the CRS_ICR register.

          ERRF:

            description: Error flag This flag is set by hardware in case of any synchronization or trimming error. It is the logical OR of the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software in reaction to setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register, which clears the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits.

          SYNCERR:
            name: SYNCERR
            description: SYNC error This flag is set by hardware when the SYNC pulse arrives before the ESYNC event and the measured frequency error is greater than or equal to FELIM * 128. This means that the frequency error is too big (internal frequency too low) to be compensated by adjusting the TRIM value, and that some other action should be taken. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register.

          SYNCMISS:
            name: SYNCMISS
            description: SYNC missed This flag is set by hardware when the frequency error counter reached value FELIM * 128 and no SYNC was detected, meaning either that a SYNC pulse was missed or that the frequency error is too big (internal frequency too high) to be compensated by adjusting the TRIM value, and that some other action should be taken. At this point, the frequency error counter is stopped (waiting for a next SYNC) and an interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register.
