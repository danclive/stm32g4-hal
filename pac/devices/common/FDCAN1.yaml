            description: ASM restricted operation mode The restricted operation mode is intended for applications that adapt themselves to different CAN bit rates. The application tests different bit rates and leaves the Restricted operation Mode after it has received a valid frame. In the optional Restricted operation Mode the node is able to transmit and receive data and remote frames and it gives acknowledge to valid frames, but it does not send active error frames or overload frames. In case of an error condition or overload condition, it does not send dominant bits, instead it waits for the occurrence of bus idle condition to resynchronize itself to the CAN communication. The error counters are not incremented. Bit ASM can only be set by software when both CCE and INIT are set to 1. The bit can be reset by the software at any time.

A cancellation request resets the corresponding transmission request pending bit of register TXBRP. In case a transmission has already been started when a cancellation is requested, this is done at the end of the transmission, regardless whether the transmission was successful or not. The cancellation request bits are reset directly after the corresponding TXBRP bit has been reset. After a cancellation has been requested, a finished cancellation is signaled via TXBCF after successful transmission together with the corresponding TXBTO bit when the transmission has not yet been started at the point of cancellation when the transmission has been aborted due to lost arbitration when an error occurred during frame transmission In DAR mode all transmissions are automatically canceled if they are not successful. The corresponding TXBCF bit is set for all unsuccessful transmissions.
